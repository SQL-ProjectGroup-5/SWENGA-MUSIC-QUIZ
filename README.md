## Installation
Just run the /fillUsers once. Afterwards the default users ("user", "admin") are created with the password "password".
After login as admin, additional users can be created.
## Features not implemented

## Known (security-) bugs
POST-mappings for many administrative functions (e.g. delete song/quiz) do not check the permission of the affected object. A user can delete the quiz of another user by manually editing the ID in the request.
CSRF tokens are not enabled due to problems with input fields.
