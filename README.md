## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the release.
2. Import existing project into eclipse
3. Add a db.properties file in the src subdirectory (a example is provided in the last section of this document).
4. Modify Java Build Path of the project as needed
5. Change jpa-properties in dispatcher-servlet.xml to required attributes (``validate``, ``update``, or ``create-drop``)
6. Start project in eclipse (Tomcat)
7. If the database is empty, the demo users have to be created by accessing the url /fillUsers (e.g. http://localhost:8080/GuessTheSong/fillUsers) only ONCE.
8. Afterwards the application can be accessed by http://localhost:8080/GuessTheSong/

Please note that some features are blocked by modern browsers, for example autoplay of songs or custom timespan of playback.

## Known (security-) bugs
POST-mappings for many administrative functions (e.g. delete song/quiz, comment and results) do not check the permission of the affected object. A user can delete the quiz of another user by manually editing the ID in the request.
CSRF tokens are not enabled due to problems with input fields.

## Example db.properties
The db.properties must contain the following:
````
db.url=jdbc:mysql://<yourServerIP>/<yourDatabase> 
db.username=username
db.password=password
````
