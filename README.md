## Known (security-) bugs
POST-mappings for many administrative functions (e.g. delete song/quiz, comment and results) do not check the permission of the affected object. A user can delete the quiz of another user by manually editing the ID in the request.
CSRF tokens are not enabled due to problems with input fields.
